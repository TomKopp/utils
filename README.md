Utility function that I find useful.

## Quick Notes

> It might be worth noting the difference between **throttling** and **debouncing**, as the terms are often confused.
> 	- A **debounced** function is called only once in a given period, delay milliseconds after its last invocation (the timer is reset on every call).
> 	- Whereas a **throttled** function is limited to be called no more than once every delay milliseconds.
